The e-Government Benchmark framework reflects on the Digital Decade and it brings insights on the state-of play of e-government in Europe. The measurement evaluates the maturity of online public services in terms of User centricity, Transparency, and use of Key enablers. It also brings the dimension of Cross-border service delivery, which is a truly European metric. The new method presents various changes e.g. simplified life events by measuring less services for national users, substantially increasing the amount of services that are measured cross-border, including the Career and the Family life events, and addition of Health life events for odd years together with relabeling of some indicators. Various indicators allow the comparison over the time and across countries. The list of countries currently includes the European Union Member States, Iceland, Norway, Montenegro, Republic of Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey as well as Albania and North Macedonia.</p>",
