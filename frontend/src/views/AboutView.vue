      This visualisation tool allows you to explore some open datasets through
      the interactive creation of charts and tables. The indicators have been
      selected to support the EU Digital Single Market policies and to monitor
      the digital progress of European Economy and Society, through annual
      reports, a DESI index and country factsheets.

      The charts can be exported as images, printed, embedded or shared through
      hyperlinks. You can download the data behind a chart or the entire
      dataset, including the metadata providing labels, definitions,
      methodological notes, references and sources. Use the "download" and
      "export" buttons present on each chart, or refer to the page "Entire
      dataset metadata and download services".

      Each dataset is stored in a semantic data repository to facilitate their
      reuse and the linking to other data published on the web. For browsing or
      querying of the semantic repository please follow the link. You will find
      functionalities for human and machine reading of data and metadata. The
      documentation page presents some reports and notes about the technical
      characteristics of the project developing the present visualisation tool
      and semantic repository.
